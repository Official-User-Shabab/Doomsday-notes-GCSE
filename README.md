# Doomsday-notes-GCSE

Here are the notes that have been finalised for my study. They have helped me revise for GCSE exams.

Even if you can't read the actual content (Very messy handwriting) you can still hopefully take inspiration on how to structure your notes.

Note some notes may not be fully correct, and neither may all my notes be uploaded.
