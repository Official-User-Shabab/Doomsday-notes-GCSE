Both English Language and Literature are based from AQA.

Texts for English Literature:

Paper 1: Macbeth, A Christmas Carol (ACC)

Paper 2: An Inspector Calls (AIC), Power and Conflict poetry

Note that different schools could have different structuring techniques for both language and literature.
